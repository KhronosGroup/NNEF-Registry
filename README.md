# NNEF-Registry

The NNEF-Registry repository contains the Neural Network Exchange Format
specification.

It is also used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
https://www.khronos.org/registry/NNEF/ ; commits to the main branch of this
repository will be reflected there.

**NOTE**: as of 2021-08-09, the default branch of this repository has
been renamed from 'master' to 'main'.

Interesting files in this repository include:

* index.php - toplevel index page for the web view. This relies on PHP
  include files found elsewhere on www.khronos.org and so is not very useful
  in isolation.
* specs/ - NNEF specification documents.
