# NNEF-Registry

The NNEF-Registry repository contains the Neural Network Exchange Format
specification.

It is also used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
https://www.khronos.org/registry/NNEF/ ; commits to the master branch of
this repository will be reflected there.

Interesting files in this repository include:

* index.php - toplevel index page for the web view. This relies on PHP
  include files found elsewhere on www.khronos.org and so is not very useful
  in isolation.
* specs/ - NNEF specification documents.
